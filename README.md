# Renewable_Power_Generation_through_power_to_X_hubs
Renewable energy from solar, wind, and biomass feeds the system. Surplus power charges batteries and drives electrolyzers to make hydrogen. Hydrogen is stored or used in fuel cells to supply electricity when demand is high, or sold as a product, generating revenue to offset P2X hub costs and support grid stability.
